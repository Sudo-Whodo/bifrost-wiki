# Bifrost's Multiple Networks

Bifrost plans to create multiple long-lived networks, including the parachain network deployed on Kusama and Polkadot, the Asgard test network, and the Rococo test network.&#x20;

* Bifrost-Asgard: deploy on Asgard relay chain maintained by Bifrost Team &#x20;
* Bifrost-Rococo: deploy on Rococo&#x20;
* Bifrost-Kusama: deploy on Kusama&#x20;
* Bifrost-Polkadot: deploy on Polkadot&#x20;

These deployment and operation strategies can minimize software upgrade attempts and maintain a reasonable update speed. As the development of each network becomes available, detailed information about each network will be added to the Wiki. The current completion status of each network is as follows:

### Bifrost-Asgard Test Network

Completed

### Bifrost-Rococo Parachain Test Network

Completed

### Bifrost-Kusama Parachain Network

### Bifrost-Polkadot Parachain Network
