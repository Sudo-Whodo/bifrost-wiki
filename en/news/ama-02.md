# Round table | Polkadot ecological Bifrost, a new scene of cross chain extension stacking

Unconsciously, the AMA activity of polkadot ecological project carried out by chain reading and polkabase has entered the 10th phase. Liandu AMA has the honor to invite "lurpis", co-founder of "Bifrost", as a guest in the chain reading studio to talk with us about "the new scene of  polkadot parallel chain Bifrost combined with cross chain extension stacking"

In the past, users always complained that they would be inflated if they didn't stack, they would be locked if they had done stacking, the market would have a good opportunity to take measures to increase the market, and there would be no way to deal with the decline of the market. They often could not have both income and liquidity.

In view of this phenomenon, lurpis told us: the application direction of Bifrost will focus on three directions: stacking without locking, lowering the stacking threshold, and improving the benefits of stacking.

The goal of Bifrost is to provide stacking liquidity for 80% of the public POS chain, allowing users to convert POS currency into vtoken through Bifrost transfer bridge, so as to obtain stacking income and liquidity.

Bifrost plays the role of stacking liquidity provider in polkadot ecosystem. After accessing Kusama, the KSM nominated to the node first will be liberated due to vksm, and the overall pledge rate of Kusama network will be improved. At the same time, some small nodes without KSM start-up funds can obtain the nomination support of Bifrost through bidding to enter the out block list and present it to the public voters.

Lurpis has brought good news: it is expected that at the end of June, Bifrost will participate in the formal auction of Kusama parallel chain card slot and complete an IPO in Kusama network. Under smooth circumstances, it can successfully access Kusama network and become its parallel chain to provide users with real KSM exchange.


The following is the whole content of this AMA:

**Hello, please briefly introduce the project Bifrost. What kind of problem does it want to solve and what is the main application direction?**

Hello, I'm lurpis, the co-founder of Bifrost. I'm very glad to cooperate with linkread to let you have a deeper understanding of Bifrost and the new models and scenarios that Bifrost brings to stacking.

Founded in July last year, Bifrost, named Rainbow Bridge in Chinese, is a Polkadot parallel chain developed by substrate, which is perpendicular to stacking ecology. Users can complete stacking and obtain corresponding rights and interests when assets cross the chain.

In the past, we heard that users always complained that they would be inflated if they didn't do stacking. If they did, they would be locked. If the market goes up, they will not be able to do anything about it. They often can't have both income and liquidity.

In this regard, Bifrost mainly uses polkadot's cross chain technology to solve the problems such as high threshold of participation, no liquidity, governance and conflict of interest. The application direction of Bifrost will focus on three directions: holding without lock, reducing the threshold of stacking, and improving the revenue of stacking.

**What is the difference between Bifrost and ACALA? Is there any possibility of cooperation between the two?**

There are many excellent parallel chain teams in polkadot ecology. In terms of cross chain multi mortgage stable currency, ACALA is doing very well. I like it very much. It belongs to a professional and reliable team. Besides providing stable currency, ACALA also has an agreement to provide stacking liquidity

However, the difference between the two in terms of liquidity seems to exist on the surface of the difference between staking and staking.

On the other hand, stacking liquidity is a very large market, which is far from reaching the stage of stock competition. Diversified competition and innovation will promote this market segment to be popularized among users more quickly. Therefore, there is a huge space for cooperation with ACALA in terms of stable currency and liquidity.

**Polkadot and DFI are hot concepts this year. What are the similarities and differences between Polkadot and Ethereum?**

At present, most of the market's difi products are built on Ethereum. However, with the growth of transaction volume, the network performance bottleneck of Ethereum has a more and more negative impact on profi. At the same time, the uncertainty brought by the transition from Ethereum 2.0 to POS will also force current profi products and users to migrate to other platforms.

At the same time, the defi products on Ethereum will be subject to the functional limitations of the smart contract itself, resulting in a part of the business must be put under the chain and run in a centralized way. However, compared with the difi project on polkadot, it highlights the flexibility boundary of the project, making the smart contract only one module, which can help the team realize the product logic to the maximum extent.

Polkadot uses the relay network to bridge the parallel chain and public chain, and builds an interconnected ecosystem. While the low-cost consensus security is used, the services will not interfere with each other, nor will the congestion of a certain product cause the gas cost of the whole network to skyrocket.

Therefore, I am more optimistic about poca. In the future, polkadot will pose a huge challenge to Ethereum in terms of ecology and performance. This is also one of the reasons why I am looking forward to the launch of polkadot's main network this year.

**Why choose polkadot / substrate? What are the natural advantages for the development of the project?**

This incident can be traced back to a year ago. Our products developed based on smart contracts encountered business bottlenecks and were unable to break through the original chain rules for further expansion. Therefore, after comparing cosmos SDK with Polkadot substrate, we finally chose substrate with low development difficulty and comprehensive documentation as the technical solution.

In terms of technology, substrate can greatly reduce the threshold of blockchain development, save a lot of development workload, and let the team focus on the product experience. In terms of products, substrate is compatible with Polkadot relay network, which makes Multi Chain scenarios can be rapidly developed. In addition, there are Web3 Foundation grant and substrate builder The plan will help from the aspects of capital, market, product, financing, planning, etc.

**How does Bifrost staking and what is the staking mechanism?**

At the user level, for example, one vtoken can be exchanged for a vtoken through the Bifrost protocol. As time goes on, one vtoken can be exchanged back to 1.5 tokens. The 0.5 token is the stacking income you get during the holding period, which is equivalent to passively participating in the stacking by holding vtoken.

Of course, the way to obtain vtoken is not only through the exchange of Bifrost agreement, but also through the exchange purchase, wallet flash and other ways to obtain vtoken. The vtoken obtained from different channels can obtain stacking income.

At the use scenario level, thanks to the general design of vtoken, it is not limited to centralized or decentralized scenarios. In other words, if users care about privacy and security, they can put vtoken in their own address. If users care about short-term liquidity, they can put them in centralized exchanges or cloud wallets. In either way, they can obtain stacking Income.

**How does Bifrost ensure the high yield and liquidity of staging and promote the marketization of staging revenue?**

Standing liquidity is provided by vtoken's liquidity incentive mechanism and cross chain usage scenarios. Liquidity incentive mechanism refers to the role providing liquidity for vtoken, who can obtain the standing income during the vtoken trading period to motivate users and market makers to provide vtoken liquidity.

Liquidity incentive mechanism refers to the role providing liquidity for vtoken, who can obtain the standing income during the vtoken trading period to motivate users and market makers to provide vtoken liquidity.

From the perspective of improving the standing income, Bifrost improves the stacking income through marketization of stacking voting rights.

Taking Kusama as an example, the voting rights of KSM in the Bifrost stacking pool are obtained by market bidding. The higher the bid, the higher the KSM Therefore, small nodes that do not reach the threshold can be self incubated and enter the public voter's field of vision to provide better service to confront the head node, making the node network more secure and healthy.

Therefore, in the period of strong demand for voting rights, the standing income generated by Bifrost may even exceed the maximum income of the original chain. As a node, you can use KSM to buy votes from the pool to increase your voting rights. It's like leverage, using the KSM annualized cost to get more votes.

Let's take another chestnut to make it easy to understand: the price of paying 40% annualisation, buying 10000 KSM and voting for 10 days is 109.58 KSM (10000 * 0.4 / 365 * 10). Compared with KSM itself with the highest 20% annualization, the extra 20% is the premium generated by node bidding, and Bifrost will also distribute it to users as stacking revenue. 报

**What role does vtoken play in staging? What are the application scenarios that the original token does not have?**

I personally feel that vtoken is an inevitable derivative in the development of stacking, and it also plays a guiding role. It can solve the problem of opportunity cost caused by the liquidity of stacking and the rise and fall of price during the lock up period, and will not interfere with the freedom of users to redeem. Vtoken does not force users to guarantee the pledge rate of the original token, but allows users to participate in staging in the most interesting way.

同时借助波卡中继网络给原 Token 提供了更多其他的应用场景。比如将 EOS 兑换 vEOS 后，去使用零知识证明的 Zerochain，变相的给 EOS 提供零知识证明解决方案，将 XZT 兑换成 vXZT，去使用智能合约平台 Edgeware，变相的给 Tezos 提供智能合约支持，将 ETH 兑换成 vETH，去使用 IOT 平行链 MXC，让 ETH 变相支持物联网设备控制。

类似的例子还有很多，总之，受益于波卡中继网络，让区块链从一个单机系统变成了一个互联网，各系统应用之间互联互通，会因网络效应带来很多让人眼前一亮的新玩法。

**BNC作为Bifrost代币，在流动性过程中，可以起到什么作用？**

哈哈，谈到这个问题，就想起了前两天举办的 BNC 红包预热活动，大家都在群里热烈的参与思考BNC的价值和应用场景。在设计之初，BNC一共有6种场景去支持Bifrost协议的运作，这六种作用分别为收益凭证、流动性激励，市值单位，票权抵押，衡量标准以及兑换媒介。

把其中与用户关系最密切也是最关心的流动性激励展开来说，就是在 vToken 流动性不足的初期，BNC 会作为奖励发放给兑换 vToken 和 提供 vToken 流动性的用户。

用户根据兑换 vToken 的市值不同、权重不同从而获得不同数量的 BNC 奖励，现在我们正在完善 1.0 正式版白皮书，其中会详细描述关于 BNC 的获取渠道以及激励方式，请大家多多关注。

**Bifrost的测试网POC-2已于3月重磅上线，未来Bifrost网络将如何发展？感兴趣的朋友，如何参与节点测试与开发？**

说到未来发展，需要时刻回头看看历史上的教训，就在这两天的 DeFi 项目，发生了一些不好的事情，Lendf 项目因为一个合约逻辑处理不当，直接导致了近 2500 万美金左右的损失。

几乎一夜归零，这个惨痛的教训给所有 DeFi 项目都上了一课，我们相信 DeFi 项目除了技术实力之外，更重要的是风险控制的能力，并不是开发上线就可以交差的产品。

这中间关于金融风险的防范是需要花费大量精力和时间去验证的，时刻保持警惕才是 DeFi 团队应该具备的品质，所以 Bifrost 团队在未来依然会保持一贯严谨认真的态度，去认真写好每一段代码，审计每一处合约，谨慎的挑选每一个优质的 PoS 资产来合作。

再说到测试网络，目前感兴趣的小伙伴已经可以运行 Bifrost 节点参与到测试网络当中来，当前还是 POA 的网络，没有开放 Staking 机制，直接执行下面的命令

`docker run -it bifrostnetwork/bifrost:poc2-v0.2.3 --name "Bifrost Node"`

这就可以完成节点搭建，主网上线后最低配置为 2 核 4GB 云主机。关于更多运行 Bifrost 测试节点的技术教程，我们还正在整理编辑，详情请见\[链接\] (https://docs.bifrost.codes)

**Bifrost在波卡生态扮演什么样的角色？之后接入KSM后的vKSM,能给波卡生态带来怎样的场景？**

Bifrost 定位很清晰，在波卡生态中扮演 Staking 流动性提供商的角色，我们会主要为围绕提供 Staking 流动性、小节点市场竞价权、降低平行链用户 Staking 门槛以及扩充 vToken 在平行链中的使用场景这几方面出发扮演好我们的角色。

接入 Kusama 之后，首先给节点提名的 KSM 会因 vKSM 被解放，Kusama 网络的整体质押率会得到提升，同时一些没有 KSM 启动资金的小节点，可以通过竞价获得 Bifrost 的提名支持，来进入到出块列表，呈现在大众投票人眼前。总之 vKSM 都是我们团队和社区中的小伙伴共同期待的一个功能。

**项目目前进展如何，预计什么时候上主网，具体的开发路线计划？**

在接下来的时间我们会继续完善 POC-2 测试网的开发工作，同时计划将 EOS Jungle 测试网跨链接入 Bifrost 测试网络。并且在 5 月 1 日计划正式启动 Bifrost Asgard 预生产网络，它将是会和 Kusama 一样永久开放的预生产网络。

想要接入 Bifrost 的团队，可以提前在 Bifrost Asgard 网络中验证业务逻辑。在 5 月底，我们计划在 Kusama 网络中进行 IPO 预演，来测试 Bifrost 整套 IPO 业务流程。

预计在 6 月底，Bifrost 将参与 Kusama 平行链卡槽的正式拍卖，完成一次 Kusama 网络中的 IPO，顺利的情况下，能够成功接入 Kusama 网络成为其平行链，来为用户提供真实的 KSM 兑换。

在 Kusama 网络中尽可能的验证和优化业务逻辑，提前排除各类线上风险，积累社群规模，做好在 Polkadot 主网上竞拍平行链卡槽的准备，总之我们会将 Bifrost 主网上线节奏和 Polkadot 主网上线进程保持一致，争取成为第一批接入 Polkadot 主网的平行链。
