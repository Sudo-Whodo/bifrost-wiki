# Round table | Polkadot ecological Bifrost, a new scene of cross chain extension stacking

Unconsciously, the AMA activity of polkadot ecological project carried out by chain reading and polkabase has entered the 10th phase. Liandu AMA has the honor to invite "lurpis", co-founder of "Bifrost", as a guest in the chain reading studio to talk with us about "the new scene of  polkadot parallel chain Bifrost combined with cross chain extension stacking"

In the past, users always complained that they would be inflated if they didn't stack, they would be locked if they had done stacking, the market would have a good opportunity to take measures to increase the market, and there would be no way to deal with the decline of the market. They often could not have both income and liquidity.

In view of this phenomenon, lurpis told us: the application direction of Bifrost will focus on three directions: stacking without locking, lowering the stacking threshold, and improving the benefits of stacking.

The goal of Bifrost is to provide stacking liquidity for 80% of the public POS chain, allowing users to convert POS currency into vtoken through Bifrost transfer bridge, so as to obtain stacking income and liquidity.

Bifrost plays the role of stacking liquidity provider in polkadot ecosystem. After accessing Kusama, the KSM nominated to the node first will be liberated due to vksm, and the overall pledge rate of Kusama network will be improved. At the same time, some small nodes without KSM start-up funds can obtain the nomination support of Bifrost through bidding to enter the out block list and present it to the public voters.

Lurpis has brought good news: it is expected that at the end of June, Bifrost will participate in the formal auction of Kusama parallel chain card slot and complete an IPO in Kusama network. Under smooth circumstances, it can successfully access Kusama network and become its parallel chain to provide users with real KSM exchange.


The following is the whole content of this AMA:

**Hello, please briefly introduce the project Bifrost. What kind of problem does it want to solve and what is the main application direction?**

Hello, I'm lurpis, the co-founder of Bifrost. I'm very glad to cooperate with linkread to let you have a deeper understanding of Bifrost and the new models and scenarios that Bifrost brings to stacking.

Founded in July last year, Bifrost, named Rainbow Bridge in Chinese, is a Polkadot parallel chain developed by substrate, which is perpendicular to stacking ecology. Users can complete stacking and obtain corresponding rights and interests when assets cross the chain.

In the past, we heard that users always complained that they would be inflated if they didn't do stacking. If they did, they would be locked. If the market goes up, they will not be able to do anything about it. They often can't have both income and liquidity.

In this regard, Bifrost mainly uses polkadot's cross chain technology to solve the problems such as high threshold of participation, no liquidity, governance and conflict of interest. The application direction of Bifrost will focus on three directions: holding without lock, reducing the threshold of stacking, and improving the revenue of stacking.

**What is the difference between Bifrost and ACALA? Is there any possibility of cooperation between the two?**

There are many excellent parallel chain teams in polkadot ecology. In terms of cross chain multi mortgage stable currency, ACALA is doing very well. I like it very much. It belongs to a professional and reliable team. Besides providing stable currency, ACALA also has an agreement to provide stacking liquidity

However, the difference between the two in terms of liquidity seems to exist on the surface of the difference between staking and staking.

On the other hand, stacking liquidity is a very large market, which is far from reaching the stage of stock competition. Diversified competition and innovation will promote this market segment to be popularized among users more quickly. Therefore, there is a huge space for cooperation with ACALA in terms of stable currency and liquidity.

**Polkadot and DFI are hot concepts this year. What are the similarities and differences between Polkadot and Ethereum?**

At present, most of the market's difi products are built on Ethereum. However, with the growth of transaction volume, the network performance bottleneck of Ethereum has a more and more negative impact on profi. At the same time, the uncertainty brought by the transition from Ethereum 2.0 to POS will also force current profi products and users to migrate to other platforms.

At the same time, the defi products on Ethereum will be subject to the functional limitations of the smart contract itself, resulting in a part of the business must be put under the chain and run in a centralized way. However, compared with the difi project on polkadot, it highlights the flexibility boundary of the project, making the smart contract only one module, which can help the team realize the product logic to the maximum extent.

Polkadot uses the relay network to bridge the parallel chain and public chain, and builds an interconnected ecosystem. While the low-cost consensus security is used, the services will not interfere with each other, nor will the congestion of a certain product cause the gas cost of the whole network to skyrocket.

Therefore, I am more optimistic about poca. In the future, polkadot will pose a huge challenge to Ethereum in terms of ecology and performance. This is also one of the reasons why I am looking forward to the launch of polkadot's main network this year.

**Why choose polkadot / substrate? What are the natural advantages for the development of the project?**

This incident can be traced back to a year ago. Our products developed based on smart contracts encountered business bottlenecks and were unable to break through the original chain rules for further expansion. Therefore, after comparing cosmos SDK with Polkadot substrate, we finally chose substrate with low development difficulty and comprehensive documentation as the technical solution.

In terms of technology, substrate can greatly reduce the threshold of blockchain development, save a lot of development workload, and let the team focus on the product experience. In terms of products, substrate is compatible with Polkadot relay network, which makes Multi Chain scenarios can be rapidly developed. In addition, there are Web3 Foundation grant and substrate builder The plan will help from the aspects of capital, market, product, financing, planning, etc.

**How does Bifrost staking and what is the staking mechanism?**

At the user level, for example, one vtoken can be exchanged for a vtoken through the Bifrost protocol. As time goes on, one vtoken can be exchanged back to 1.5 tokens. The 0.5 token is the stacking income you get during the holding period, which is equivalent to passively participating in the stacking by holding vtoken.

Of course, the way to obtain vtoken is not only through the exchange of Bifrost agreement, but also through the exchange purchase, wallet flash and other ways to obtain vtoken. The vtoken obtained from different channels can obtain stacking income.

At the use scenario level, thanks to the general design of vtoken, it is not limited to centralized or decentralized scenarios. In other words, if users care about privacy and security, they can put vtoken in their own address. If users care about short-term liquidity, they can put them in centralized exchanges or cloud wallets. In either way, they can obtain stacking Income.

**How does Bifrost ensure the high yield and liquidity of staging and promote the marketization of staging revenue?**

Standing liquidity is provided by vtoken's liquidity incentive mechanism and cross chain usage scenarios. Liquidity incentive mechanism refers to the role providing liquidity for vtoken, who can obtain the standing income during the vtoken trading period to motivate users and market makers to provide vtoken liquidity.

Standing liquidity is provided by vtoken's liquidity incentive mechanism and cross chain usage scenarios. Liquidity incentive mechanism refers to the role providing liquidity for vtoken, who can obtain the standing income during the vtoken trading period to motivate users and market makers to provide vtoken liquidity.

From the perspective of improving the standing income, Bifrost improves the stacking income through marketization of stacking voting rights.

Taking Kusama as an example, the voting rights of KSM in the Bifrost stacking pool are obtained by market bidding. The higher the bid, the higher the KSM Therefore, small nodes that do not reach the threshold can be self incubated and enter the public voter's field of vision to provide better service to confront the head node, making the node network more secure and healthy.

Therefore, in the period of strong demand for voting rights, the standing income generated by Bifrost may even exceed the maximum income of the original chain. As a node, you can use KSM to buy votes from the pool to increase your voting rights. It's like leverage, using the KSM annualized cost to get more votes.

Let's take another chestnut to make it easy to understand: the price of paying 40% annualisation, buying 10000 KSM and voting for 10 days is 109.58 KSM (10000 * 0.4 / 365 * 10). Compared with KSM itself with the highest 20% annualization, the extra 20% is the premium generated by node bidding, and Bifrost will also distribute it to users as stacking revenue. æŠ¥

**What role does vtoken play in staging? What are the application scenarios that the original token does not have?**

I personally feel that vtoken is an inevitable derivative in the development of stacking, and it also plays a guiding role. It can solve the problem of opportunity cost caused by the liquidity of stacking and the rise and fall of price during the lock up period, and will not interfere with the freedom of users to redeem. Vtoken does not force users to guarantee the pledge rate of the original token, but allows users to participate in staging in the most interesting way.

At the same time, it provides more other application scenarios for the original token with the help of polkadot relay network. For example, after converting EOS to VEOS, zero knowledge proof zerochain is used to provide EOS with zero knowledge proof solution in disguise, XZT is converted into vxzt, and edgeware is used as smart contract platform to provide smart contract support for tezos in disguise, exchange eth into veh, and use IOT parallel chain MXC to make eth support IOT device control in disguise.

There are many similar examples. In short, thanks to the polkadot relay network, the blockchain has become an Internet from a stand-alone system. The interconnection between system applications will bring a lot of new ways to play that will bring people a bright new play due to the network effect.

**As a Bifrost token, what role can BNC play in the liquidity process?**

Ha ha, when it comes to this issue, I think of the BNC red envelope warm-up activity held two days ago. Everyone in the group enthusiastically participated in thinking about the value and application scenarios of BNC. At the beginning of the design, BNC has six scenarios to support the operation of the Bifrost agreement, which are income voucher, liquidity incentive, market value unit, coupon mortgage, measurement standard and exchange medium.

The most closely related and most concerned liquidity incentive among users is that BNC will give rewards to users who exchange vtoken and provide vtoken liquidity at the initial stage of insufficient liquidity.

Users can get different amounts of BNC awards according to the different market value and weight of vtoken. Now we are improving the official version of the white paper 1.0, which will describe in detail the acquisition channels and incentive methods of BNC. Please pay more attention.

**The test network poc-2 of Bifrost has been launched in March. How will Bifrost network develop in the future? Interested friends, how to participate in node testing and development?**

When it comes to future development, we need to always look back at the lessons of history. In the past two days, some bad things happened in the defi project. The lendf project directly caused a loss of about US $25 million due to the improper handling of a contract logic.

It almost went back to zero overnight. This painful lesson has taught all defi projects a lesson. We believe that in addition to the technical strength of the project, the more important thing is the ability to control risks, not to develop products that can be delivered online.

The prevention of financial risks needs to spend a lot of energy and time to verify. Keeping vigilance is the quality that the defi team should have. Therefore, the Bifrost team will still maintain a rigorous and serious attitude in the future, seriously write every piece of code, review every contract, and carefully select every high-quality POS asset to cooperate. CONTEXTREQUEST

As for the test network, at present, interested partners can run the Bifrost node to participate in the test network. At present, it is still a POA network. There is no open staging mechanism, and the following commands are directly executed

`docker run -it bifrostnetwork/bifrost:poc2-v0.2.3 --name "Bifrost Node"`

This can complete the node construction. After the main network is online, the minimum configuration is 2-core 4GB virtual machine. For more technical tutorials on running Bifrost test nodes, we are also editing them. For details, please refer to [link]ï¼ˆ https://docs.bifrost.codes )

**What role does Bifrost play in Boca ecology? What kind of scene can the vksm with KSM access bring to Boca ecology?**

Bifrost has a clear positioning and plays a role as a liquidity provider in  polkadot ecosystem. We will play our role mainly around providing stacking liquidity, bidding rights for small nodes, reducing the stacking threshold of users in parallel chain, and expanding the usage scenarios of vtoken in the parallel chain.

After accessing Kusama, the KSM nominated for the node will be liberated due to vksm, and the overall pledge rate of Kusama network will be improved. At the same time, some small nodes without KSM start-up funds can obtain the nomination support of Bifrost through bidding to enter the block list and present it to the voters. In short, vksm is a function that our team and our community expect together.

**What is the current progress of the project, when is it expected to be launched on the main network, and the specific development route plan?**

In the following time, we will continue to improve the development of poc-2 test network, and plan to cross link the EOS jungle test network to the Bifrost test network. And on May 1, it is planned to officially launch the pre production network of Bifrost Asgard, which will be open permanently like Kusama.

Teams who want to access Bifrost can verify the business logic in the Bifrost Asgard network in advance. At the end of May, we plan to conduct an IPO preview in Kusama network to test the entire IPO business process of Bifrost.

It is expected that at the end of June, Bifrost will participate in the formal auction of Kusama parallel chain card slot and complete an IPO in Kusama network. Under smooth circumstances, Bifrost can successfully access Kusama network to become its parallel chain to provide users with real KSM exchange.

In Kusama network, we will verify and optimize business logic as much as possible, eliminate all kinds of online risks in advance, accumulate community scale, and be ready to bid for parallel chain card slot on Polkadot main network. In short, we will keep the line rhythm of Bifrost main network consistent with the online process of Polkadot main network, and strive to become the first batch of parallel chains connected to Polkadot main network.
