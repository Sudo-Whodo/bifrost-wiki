# Bifrost First AMA: The new play of Staking + DeFi ——How to combine liquidity with high rewards

**Host: Hello everyone, and welcome to the first online AMA of Bifrost. I'm host Bonnie~**

**After five months of development preparation, Bifrost gradually entered the public eye. It from the initial concept to today's test network, constantly bring everyone surprises. In the first AMA, Lurpis, co-founder & core developer of Bifrost, will take the wonderful world of Bifrost to you. This session is divided into two parts, the moderator questions and the audience free questions.**

**Host: firstly, let's welcome Lurpis to make a brief introduction to Bifrost.**

Hi, I'm Lurpis from Bifrost and I'm here to share about Bifrost.

Bifrost is a cross-chain network, which can provide Staking liquidity. Users can exchange PoS token into Bifrost vToken by Bifrost transfer bridge at any time to get Staking income and liquidity. For example, users can exchange EOS into vEOS, and at the same time, they can receive the income from EOS Staking, they can also sell vEOS and redeem EOS at any time. Also, VEOS can be used in DeFi, Dapp, DEX and other scenarios. For example, when using vEOS as collateral for lending, the income from Staking can pay part of the interest and realize low-interest lending. There are other extremely good parachains projects in the Polkadot ecology, such as Acala network, which committed to stablecoin in the Polkadot ecology, and Darwin network, which focus on game ecology. All of they are possible extensions of vToken usage scenarios.

**2. Host: so what, what role does vToken play in staking? How does it provide liquidity for Staking?**

First, vToken is a sort of general token used to provide Staking liquidity. Take KSM for example, when the user votes directly to the node the KSM in the nomination state will be locked. If you want to sell the KSM, you need to wait at least 7 days of redemption. If a short-term collapse occurs during the redemption period, users can do nothing but watch their assets depreciate. But through the Bifrost Staking, user can obtain vKSM according to the exchange rate. When the market short-term collapsed, vKSM can be sold directly. In addition, vKSM can also transfer, trade, use it in Dapp at will, even use it as security in DeFi, or lend it to others for the double benefit of Staking and lending.

**3. Host: got it. Simply speaking, the original token can continue to accept the income from Staking, while the replaced vToken can replace the original token to continue to participate in the market behavior for trading or investment. So how do we get vToken? How can we get it?**

There are basically two ways to get vToken.

1, through the Bifrost exchange contract, Token can converted into vToken directly according to the exchange rate at that time. 2, Because vToken is a general assets agreement that can be traded on the market, users can go to the exchange to purchase vToken directly, also can receive the income from Staking. Besides, in order to reduce the threshold, we will also provide functions similar to swap. Bifrost-App is expected to be launched as a beta version on April 15. Users can receive KSM and DOT tokens of Bifrost test network from Telegram BOT, and then experience the exchange, trading and revenue functions in Bifrost-App.

**4. Host: After knowing the way of vToken acquisition, can you tell us about the benefits of vToken? Where does the revenue come from? Where will it be valuable?**

In terms of benefits, also divided into two parts, the first part guaranteed income depends on the Staking rules of the public blockchain, such as the KSM currently nominated annualised rate of 20%, then vKSM will be at least 20% annualized returns, the second part of the proceeds from the competition for the right to vote for Bifrost Staking Pool, different nodes are willing to pay a higher premium for nomination, then corresponds to the user's Staking gains even beyond KSM.

Meanwhile, the nomination bidding of Bifrost Staking Pool will give small nodes with good service but few votes a chance to compete with super nodes, making PoS network more decentralized and safer.

**5. After listening to your explanation of vToken, I think vToken does bring better liquidity to Staking, and I also hope vToken can be used in more scenarios. As mentioned earlier, Bifrost is a parachains of Polkadot, and can you talk a little bit about what parachains is?**

Parachains is applications of Polkadot relay network, independent of each other is business chain. But different from other common public blockchain, data can be exchanged between parachains. There is a special kind of parachains called transfer bridge. The function of the transfer bridge is to connect other blockchain bridges into the Polkadot network, so that the parachains and other public chains can also achieve interoperability. Just like the EOS transfer bridge being done by Bifrost, we hope to transfer EOS into Polkadot ecology. user both can get mobility of EOS Staking, and let EOS users experience other parachains applications in Polkadot ecology.

**6. Host: I see. Recently, we have seen some friends who have been looking forward to the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot.**

It is expected that the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot in 2020 in June, but before this, Kusama had been released as a test network, which is a time period fast Polkadot four times the open network. Independent of Polkadot, KSM will permanent run, the vast majority of Polkadot logic can be verified on the Kusama, teams who want to be part of the Polkadot ecological，starting from the Kusama is a good choice. Bifrost will access to Kusama network before access to Polkadot and will also support vKSM exchange.

**7. Host: Seventh, I would like to ask Lurpis to give you a brief introduction to the process of card slot auction before the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot. What efforts has Bifrost made?**

After the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot, it is expected to open the auction of parallel chain card slots, which will be held once half a year. And, the number of card slots will not be very large at the beginning. parachain teams that need card slots need to lock DOT to participate in the auction of 6-24 months 'use of card slots. before the first time in the parachain IPO ( initial parachain offer) plan, Bifrost will participate in the auction of parachain card slots, also known as an IPO. If you hold the DOT, you can participate in the IPO. If Bifrost success in the parachain slot auction, then you will get a lot of BNC in return. the DOT to participate in the IPO will be locked in parachain slot instead of being consumed, but is locked in parallel to the chain slot, the locking time depends on the usage time of parachain slots. After slots expire, you can get your DOT back intact, and all you're losing in the IPO is the interest of DOT Staking and the opportunity of holding DOT for that period of time.

**8.Host: We all know that Bifrost was funded by the WEB3 Foundation not long ago. Can we talk a little bit about the current cooperation with WEB3 and Polkadot?**

Bifrost, as the first Substrate Hackathon award-winning project, first appeared in the public view, and is also as a Grant project funded by Web3 Foundation. besides, Bifrost needs to use the relay network of Substrate and Polkadot to complete the business logic, its ecological coordination with Polkadot is relatively close. Of course, Bifrost as a parachain in Polkadot, the first to be supported will also be vToken for Polkadot-related assets such as vDOT and vKSM, and we are happy to cooperate if there is a need for Staking liquidity in other parachain.

**9. Host: After hearing your ideas, we are looking forward to the development of Bifrost. Could you tell us something about the current progress of the Bifrost project?**

Bifrost released poc-2 Testnet on March 21, 2020, in just a week to participate in the node is reached 25, distributed in the whole world. In the POC-2 test network, we verified a series of logic such as bifrost-Node block stability, POA governance, vToken exchange rate adjustment and so on. Meanwhile, we started to build user communities and establish market cooperation.

**10. Host: last question, what is the roadmap of Bifrost's future?**

In the next time we will continue to improve the POC - 2 testnet development work, and plan to enter EOS Jungle test network into Bifrost test network. And it is planned that the Bifrost Asgard Pre-production network will be officially launched on May 1st, which will similar to the Kusama that will be permanently open as a Chaos network, teams who want to participate in Bifrost，can validate the business logic in advance in the Bifrost Asgard network. On May 30, we plan to conduct IPO preview on Kusama network to test the entire IPO process of Bifrost. It is expected that on June 30, Bifrost will become Kusama Parachain and provide real KSM exchange. In short, we will try to keep the rhythm of Bifrost's mainnet launching with that of Polkadot's main network, and strive to be the first parachain to access Polkadot's main network.
