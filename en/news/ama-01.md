# Bifrost First AMA: The new play of Staking + DeFi ——How to combine mobility with high return

**Host: Hello everyone, and welcome to the first online AMA of Bifrost. I'm host Bonnie~**

**After five months of development preparation, Bifrost gradually entered the public eye. It from the initial concept to today's test network, constantly bring everyone surprises. In the first AMA, Lurpis, co-founder & core developer of Bifrost, will take the wonderful world of Bifrost to you. This session is divided into two parts, the moderator questions and the audience free questions.**

**Host: firstly, let's welcome Lurpis to make a brief introduction to Bifrost.**

Hi, I'm Lurpis from Bifrost and I'm here to share about Bifrost.

Bifrost is a cross-chain network, which can provide Staking liquidity. Users can exchange PoS token into Bifrost vToken by Bifrost transfer bridge at any time to get Staking income and liquidity. For example, users can exchange EOS into vEOS, and at the same time, they can receive the income from EOS Staking, they can also sell vEOS and redeem EOS at any time. Also, VEOS can be used in DeFi, Dapp, DEX and other scenarios. For example, when using vEOS as collateral for lending, the income from Staking can pay part of the interest and realize low-interest lending. There are other extremely good parachains projects in the Polkadot ecology, such as Acala network, which committed to stablecoin in the Polkadot ecology, and Darwin network, which focus on game ecology. All of they are possible extensions of vToken usage scenarios.

**2. Host: so what, what role does vToken play in staking? How does it provide liquidity for Staking?**

First, vToken is a sort of general token used to provide Staking liquidity. Take KSM for example, when the user votes directly to the node the KSM in the nomination state will be locked. If you want to sell the KSM, you need to wait at least 7 days of redemption. If a short-term collapse occurs during the redemption period, users can do nothing but watch their assets depreciate. But through the Bifrost Staking, user can obtain vKSM according to the exchange rate. When the market short-term collapsed, vKSM can be sold directly. In addition, vKSM can also transfer, trade, use it in Dapp at will, even use it as security in DeFi, or lend it to others for the double benefit of Staking and lending.

**3. Host: got it. Simply speaking, the original token can continue to accept the income from Staking, while the replaced vToken can replace the original token to continue to participate in the market behavior for trading or investment. So how do we get vToken? How can we get it?**

There are basically two ways to get vToken.

1, through the Bifrost exchange contract, Token can converted into vToken directly according to the exchange rate at that time. 2, Because vToken is a general assets agreement that can be traded on the market, users can go to the exchange to purchase vToken directly, also can receive the income from Staking. Besides, in order to reduce the threshold, we will also provide functions similar to swap. Bifrost-App is expected to be launched as a beta version on April 15. Users can receive KSM and DOT tokens of Bifrost test network from Telegram BOT, and then experience the exchange, trading and revenue functions in Bifrost-App.

**4. Host: After knowing the way of vToken acquisition, can you tell us about the benefits of vToken? Where does the revenue come from? Where will it be valuable?**

In terms of benefits, also divided into two parts, the first part guaranteed income depends on the Staking rules of the public blockchain, such as the KSM currently nominated annualised rate of 20%, then vKSM will be at least 20% annualized returns, the second part of the proceeds from the competition for the right to vote for Bifrost Staking Pool, different nodes are willing to pay a higher premium for nomination, then corresponds to the user's Staking gains even beyond KSM.

Meanwhile, the nomination bidding of Bifrost Staking Pool will give small nodes with good service but few votes a chance to compete with super nodes, making PoS network more decentralized and safer.

**5. After listening to your explanation of vToken, I think vToken does bring better liquidity to Staking, and I also hope vToken can be used in more scenarios. As mentioned earlier, Bifrost is a parachains of Polkadot, and can you talk a little bit about what parachains is?**

Parachains is applications of Polkadot relay network, independent of each other is business chain. But different from other common public blockchain, data can be exchanged between parachains. There is a special kind of parachains called transfer bridge. The function of the transfer bridge is to connect other blockchain bridges into the Polkadot network, so that the parachains and other public chains can also achieve interoperability. Just like the EOS transfer bridge being done by Bifrost, we hope to transfer EOS into Polkadot ecology. user both can get mobility of EOS Staking, and let EOS users experience other parachains applications in Polkadot ecology.

**6. Host: I see. Recently, we have seen some friends who have been looking forward to the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot.**

It is expected that the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot in 2020 in June, but before this, Kusama had been released as a test network, which is a time period fast Polkadot four times the open network. Independent of Polkadot, KSM will permanent run, the vast majority of Polkadot logic can be verified on the Kusama, teams who want to be part of the Polkadot ecological，starting from the Kusama is a good choice. Bifrost will access to Kusama network before access to Polkadot and will also support vKSM exchange.

**7. Host: Seventh, I would like to ask Lurpis to give you a brief introduction to the process of card slot auction before the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot. What efforts has Bifrost made?**

波卡主网上线后，预计开放平行链卡槽的拍卖，每半年举行一次，据我们所知，一开始的卡槽数量并不会很多，需要卡槽的平行链团队需要锁定 DOT 来参与卡槽 6 - 24 个月使用权的竞拍。同时 Bifrost 会在平行链竞拍前开启首次平行链 IPO（initial parachain offer）计划，也称作 IPO，如果你手中持有 DOT 就可以参与到这次 IPO 中来，如果 Bifrost 成功拍中平行链插槽，那么你将会获得丰厚的 BNC 作为回报，同时参与 IPO 的 DOT 不会被消耗，而是被锁定在平行链插槽中，锁定时间根据平行链插槽使用时间而定，在平行链插槽到期后，你将原封不动的拿回你的 DOT，参与 IPO 你损失的仅仅是这段时间的 DOT Staking 成本和持有 DOT 的机会成本。

**8. 主持人：我们都了解过 Bifrost 不久前获得了 WEB3 的基金会的资助，可以简单谈谈与 WEB3 及波卡目前的合作吗？**

Bifrost 作为首届 Substrate Hackathon 获奖项目第一次出现在大众视野，也是 Web3 基金会 Grant 的资助项目，同时也因为 Bifrost 需要借助 Substrate 和 Polkadot 中继链来完成业务逻辑，所以和 Polkadot 生态协调比较紧密，当然，Bifrost 作为 Polkadot 平行链，最先支持的也会是 Polkadot 相关资产的 vToken，比如 vDOT 和 vKSM，如果其他平行链有 Staking 流动性的需求，我们也很高兴可以产生合作。

**9. 主持人：听完您的想法，我们也对 Bifrost 的发展充满了期待，那么您可以讲讲 Bifrost 项目目前的进展吗？**

Bifrost 于今年（2020） 3 月 21 日发布了 POC-2 Testnet，短短一周参与的节点就达到 25 个，分布在全球多地，在 POC-2 测试网中我们验证了 Bifrost-node 出块稳定性，POA 治理，vToken 汇率调整等一系列逻辑，同时在测试网络期间，我们已经开始了用户社群的搭建和市场合作的建立。

**10. 主持人：最后一个问题啦，Bifrost 未来的 roadmap 是什么呢？**

在接下来的时间我们会继续完善 POC-2 测试网的开发工作，同时计划将 EOS Jungle 测试网跨链进入 Bifrost 测试网络，并且在 5 月 1 日计划正式启动 Bifrost Asgard 预生产网络，它将是会和 Kusama 一样永久开放的 Chaos 网络，想要接入 Bifrost 的团队，可以提前在 Bifrost Asgard 网络中验证业务逻辑。在 5 月 30 日，我们计划在 Kusama 网络中进行 IPO 预演，来测试 Bifrost 整套 IPO 业务流程。预计在 6 月 30 日，Bifrost 将成为 Kusama Parachain，提供真实的 KSM 兑换，总之我们会尽量将 Bifrost 主网上线节奏和 Polkadot 主网上线进程保持一致，争取成为第一批接入 Polkadot 主网的平行链。
