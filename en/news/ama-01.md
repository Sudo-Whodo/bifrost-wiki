# The new play of Staking + DeFi | How to combine liquidity with high rewards.

**Host: Hello everyone, and welcome to the first online AMA of Bifrost. I'm host Bonnie~**

**After five months of development preparation, Bifrost gradually entered the public vision. It from the initial concept to today's test network, constantly bring everyone surprises. In the first AMA, Lurpis, co-founder & core developer of Bifrost, will take the wonderful world of Bifrost to you. This session is divided into two parts, the host questions and the audience free questions.**

**Host: firstly, let's welcome Lurpis to make a brief introduction to Bifrost.**

大家好，我是 Bifrost 的 Lurpis 今天来给大家分享一下 Bifrost。

Bifrost is a cross-chain network, which can provide Staking liquidity. Users can exchange PoS Token into Bifrost vToken by Bifrost transfer bridge at any time to get Staking income and liquidity. For example, users can exchange EOS into vEOS. At the same time, they can receive the income from EOS Staking, also sell vEOS and redeem EOS at any time. Also, VEOS can be used in DeFi, Dapp, DEX and other scenarios. For example, when using vEOS as collateral for lending, the income from Staking can pay part of the interest and realize low-interest lending. There are other extremely good parachains projects in the Polkadot ecology, such as Acala network, which committed to stablecoin in the Polkadot ecology, and Darwin network, which focus on game ecology. All of they are possible extensions of vToken usage scenarios.

**2. Host: so, what role does vToken play in staking? How does it provide liquidity for Staking?**

First, vToken is a sort of general token used to provide Staking liquidity. Take KSM for example, when the user votes directly to the node the KSM in the nomination state will be locked. If you want to sell the KSM, you need to wait at least 7 days of redemption. If a short-term collapse occurs during the redemption period, users can do nothing but watch their assets depreciate. But through the Bifrost Staking, user can obtain vKSM according to the exchange rate. When the market short-term collapsed, vKSM can be sold directly. In addition, vKSM can also transfer, trade, use it in Dapp at will, even use it as security in DeFi, or lend it to others for the double benefit of Staking and lending.

**3. Host: Got it. Simply speaking, the original token can continue to accept the income from Staking, while the replaced vToken can replace the original token to continue to participate in the market behavior for trading or investment. So how do we get vToken? Which channels do we get it?**

vToken 获取大体上分两种方式

1、Bifrost exchange contract, Token can converted into vToken directly according to the exchange rate at that time. 2、Because vToken is a general assets agreement that can be traded on the market, users can buy vToken directly in the crypotcurrency exchange, also can receive the income from Staking. Besides, in order to reduce the threshold, we will also provide functions similar to swap. Bifrost-App is expected to be launched as a test version on April 15. Users can receive KSM and DOT test Tokens of Bifrost test network from Telegram BOT, and then experience the exchange, trading and revenue functions in Bifrost-App.

**4. Host: After knowing the way of vToken acquisition, can you tell us about the benefits of vToken? Where does the revenue come from? Where will it be valuable?**

In terms of benefits, also divided into two parts, the first part guaranteed income depends on the Staking rules of the public blockchain, such as the KSM currently nominated annualised rate of 20%, then vKSM will be at least 20% annualized returns. The second part of the proceeds come from bidding on the voting right of Bifrost Staking Pool, different nodes are willing to pay a higher premium for nomination, then corresponds to the user's Staking gains even beyond KSM.

Meanwhile, the nomination bidding of Bifrost Staking Pool will give small nodes with good service but few votes a chance to compete with super nodes, making PoS network more decentralized and safer.

**5. After listening to your explanation of vToken, I think vToken does bring better liquidity to Staking, and I also hope vToken can be used in more scenarios. As mentioned earlier, Bifrost is a parachains of Polkadot, and can you talk a little bit about what parachains is?**

Parachains is applications of Polkadot relay network, independent of each other is business chain. But different from other common public blockchain, data can be exchanged between parachains. There is a special kind of parachains called transfer bridge. The function of the transfer bridge is to connect other blockchain bridges into the Polkadot network, so that the parachains and other public chains can also achieve interoperability. Just like the EOS transfer bridge Bifrost is developing, we hope to transfer EOS into Polkadot ecology. User both can get liquidity of EOS Staking, and let EOS users experience other parachains applications in Polkadot ecology.

**6. Host: I see. Recently, we have seen some friends who have been looking forward to the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot. Can you tell us a little bit about the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot?**

波卡的主网上线预计在 2020 年的六月份。但是在波卡主网上线之前，已经预先发布了预生产网络 Kusama，Kusama 是一个时间周期快于波卡 4 倍的开放网络，并且将独立于波卡永久的运行下去。绝大多数波卡的逻辑都会在 Kusama 上可以被验证。对于想要接入波卡生态的团队来说，从 Kusama 开始是一个不错的选择。Bifrost 也将在接入波卡之前提前接入 Kusama 网络，支持  vKSM 的兑换。

**7. Host: Seventh, I would like to ask Lurpis to give you a brief introduction to the process of card slot auction before the launch of the mainnet of Polkadot. What efforts has Bifrost made?**

Once the Polkadot mainnet is online, it is expected to open up parachain slots auction, which will be held every six months. As far as we know, there won't be many slots to begin with. Parachain teams that need slots will have to lock in the DOT to bid on the 6 - 24 months usage of the slots. At the same time Bifrost will open its (Initial Parachain Offer) IPO before the parachain auction. If you hold DOTs you can participate in this IPO, and if Bifrost is successful in the auction of Parachain slots, then you will receive a generous BNCs as return. DOTs that also participate in the IPO are not consumed, but are locked in the parachain slot. The duration of the lockup depends on how long the parachain slot is used. After the parachain slot expires, you get your DOT back, and all you lose by participating in the IPO is the cost of DOT Staking time and the opportunity cost of holding the DOT.

**8.Host: We all know that Bifrost was funded by the WEB3 Foundation not long ago. Can we talk a little bit about the current cooperation with WEB3 and Polkadot?**

Bifrost 作为首届 Substrate Hackathon 获奖项目第一次出现在大众视野，也是 Web3 基金会 Grant 的资助项目。因为 Bifrost 需要借助 Substrate 和 Polkadot 中继链来完成业务逻辑，所以和 Polkadot 生态协调比较紧密。当然，Bifrost 作为 Polkadot 平行链，最先支持的也会是 Polkadot 相关资产的 vToken，比如 vDOT 和 vKSM。如果其他平行链有 Staking 流动性的需求，我们也很高兴可以合作。

**9. Host: After hearing your ideas, we are looking forward to the development of Bifrost. Could you tell us something about the current progress of the Bifrost project?**

Bifrost 于 2020年 3 月 21 日发布了 POC-2 Testnet，短短一周参与的节点就达到 25 个，分布在全球多地。在 POC-2 测试网中我们验证了 Bifrost-node 出块稳定性，POA 治理，vToken 汇率调整等一系列逻辑，同时在测试网络期间，我们已经开始了用户社群的搭建和市场合作的建立。

**10. Host: last question, what is the roadmap of Bifrost's future?**

在接下来的时间我们会继续完善 POC-2 测试网的开发工作，同时计划将 EOS Jungle 测试网跨链进入 Bifrost 测试网络，并且在 5 月 1 日计划正式启动 Bifrost Asgard 预生产网络，它将是会和 Kusama 一样永久开放的 Chaos 网络。想要接入 Bifrost 的团队，可以提前在 Bifrost Asgard 网络中验证业务逻辑。在 5 月 30 日，我们计划在 Kusama 网络中进行 IPO 预演，来测试 Bifrost 整套 IPO 业务流程。预计在 6 月 30 日，Bifrost 将成为 Kusama Parachain，提供真实的 KSM 兑换。总之我们会尽量将 Bifrost 主网上线节奏和 Polkadot 主网上线进程保持一致，争取成为第一批接入 Polkadot 主网的平行链。
