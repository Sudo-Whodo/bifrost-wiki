# Another defi project, Bifrost, of polkadot ecology. How about it? PW interview with Bifrost core development

Bifrost is another difi project of polkadot ecology, which has obtained grant from Web3 foundation. It aims to lower the user staging threshold and improve the standing revenue. Polkaworld interviewed lupris, founder of Bifrost, to learn more about Bifrost.


**1. I seem to remember that your competition on polkaworld Hackathon is Bifrost. How did this project start?**

Bifrost was established in July 2019. However, before the launch of Bifrost, we launched a decentralized POS pool with stacking liquidity. At that time, it was the stacking boom, and there was no staging in the market With the concept of liquidity and no need to lock the warehouse, thanks to this, the fund scale of users' participation has reached nearly 500K USD in just two weeks' online time of the product. However, the shortcomings of smart contract development based on single chain were found very quickly, and it was difficult to copy this mode to multiple chains. Therefore, after technical research, it was found that the combination of Polkadot relay chain and substrate development framework could solve this hard problem, so the project Bifrost was born.

**2. What kind of problems does Bifrost aim to solve? What's the difference between stafi and ACALA networks, which also received grant from the Web3 foundation? What different problems have you solved?**

Fortunately, it has been able to make progress with excellent teams like ACALA and stafi. Compared with ACALA and stafi, Bifrost aims to provide liquidity for stacking, and at the same time, it focuses more on lowering the user's staging threshold and improving the revenue of stacking.

In terms of lowering the threshold of staging, taking Kusama as an example, users do not need to perform tedious operations such as locking warehouse, selecting nodes, and nominating, but only need to hold vksm to obtain stacking benefits. The way to obtain vksm is also very simple, such as through wallet exchange, exchange purchase, activity collection, OTC trading and so on. At the same time, vksm can also transfer and sell at any time without waiting for the time of redemption and lock up, so as to greatly reduce the cognitive and psychological threshold of users' participation in stacking.

On the other hand, Bifrost will provide a bidding market for voting rights. Taking Kusama as an example, the voting rights of KSM in the Bifrost stacking pool are obtained by market bidding. Who bid higher will get the corresponding number of KSMS in the Bifrost stacking pool Therefore, small nodes that do not reach the threshold can be self incubated and enter the public voter's field of vision to provide better service to confront the head node, making the node network more secure and healthy. Therefore, in the period of strong demand for voting rights, the standing income generated by Bifrost may even exceed the maximum income of the original chain.

**3. If I am now a candidate node for Kusama, can I increase our voting rights by bidding in the Bifrost stacking pool?**

Well, yes. Like an exchange bill, you can use KSM to buy tickets from the pool to increase your voting rights. It's like leverage, using the KSM annualized cost to get more votes.

For example, if you pay 40% annualisation, the price to buy 10000 KSM and vote for 10 days is 109.58 KSM (10000 * 0.4 / 365 * 10).

**4. What stage is Bifrost in? How to access Boca ecology and contribute to it in the future?**

Last Saturday (March 21), we released the Bifrost poc-2 test network to test the node stability and verify some business logic.

Next, we plan to bridge the EOS test network to complete the preliminary cross chain test. As a parallel chain providing multi chain asset stacking liquidity, Bifrost will be more dependent on Polkadot relay network. Therefore, how to successfully bid for slots is an important link in our planning. Bifrost plans to conduct IPO at the initial open auction of parallel chain For initial parachain offers, users participating in IPO will receive BNC (Bifrost network coin) as an incentive. For more details, please pay attention to the release of IPO plan after Bifrost. Vtoken, which is connected to Polkadot ecology, is developed based on the general asset protocol, which makes other parallel chains compatible easily. Users have completed the cross chain while using the stacking liquidity provided by Bifrost. Therefore, Bifrost not only attracts users of POS public chain, but also imports users for other parallel chains in Polkadot.

**5. What kind of work were you doing before you started Bifrost?**

I played bitcoin with my colleagues when I was developing Sina Weibo. After reading a lot of relevant materials about bitcoin and blockchain, I became very interested in blockchain technology. Later, I deeply studied blockchain when I was doing cross-border payment business in Ping + +. At that time, I thought the "virtual asset uniqueness" of blockchain This point is too great, and it will certainly bring great changes to the world of gradual informatization. At that time, the research found that the user experience of blockchain products on the market was generally poor, and the learning cost was high, which blocked many potential users. Therefore, in October 2017, the user experience of blockchain products was generally poor, and the learning cost was high Month and his partners jointly founded Li coin, with the vision of "making the blockchain simpler", hoping to make efforts in improving user experience and lowering the threshold of participation, so as to make blockchain products popular.

**6、你怎么注意到了波卡和 Substrate？**

初次接触波卡应该是从 Substrate 开始的，当时基于智能合约开发的业务受限，在寻找解决方案时了解到 Substrate 可能是一个可行的技术框架，在对比过 Cosmos-SDK 和 Substrate 之后，最终我们选择了 Substrate。

**7、Substrate 对你和你的团队最大的帮助是什么？**

在技术方面，降低区块链开发门槛，节省大量开发工作量，在产品方面，Substrate 原生兼容 Polkadot 中继网络，使得多链场景可以快速展开，当然除此之外还有 Web3 foundation grant 和 Substrate builder 计划会从资金、市场、产品、融资、规划等多个方面提供帮助。

**8、可以分享下是如何拿到的 Web3 基金会的 grant 的吗？**

我认为没有什么特别的技巧，只要是符合 Web3 愿景，可以产生实际价值，踏实做事的团队，都有机会拿到 Web3 基金会的 Grant，推荐有想法、有技术的团队都可以试着申请一下。

**9、2020 年你对波卡和 Bifrost 最大的期待是什么？**

今年对波卡最大的期待当然是 XCMP 跨链协议的顺利上线，相信波卡生态内其他团队也都在时刻关注着 XCMP 的最新进展。对于 Bifrost 来说，想要与其他 DeFi 项目（如抵押借贷）建立合作的基础是资产流动性，所以期待 Bifrost 在今年可以很好的实现 Staking 流动性建设和投票权的市场化，我们的目标是在 XCMP 协议发布之后的六个月内，能够提供至少三种资产的 Staking 流动性，同时 vToken 总市值达到 10M USD 规模。
