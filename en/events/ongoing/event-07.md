# Asgard CC2 Node Campaign

It has been nearly two months since Asgard CC1 (Candidate Chain 1) was released on May 21. In the past two months, Bifrost has made overall optimizations and improvements in the functions of **node**, **Validator** and **EOS cross-chain**. In terms of nodes, the **Swap algorithm** has been upgraded to support more currency liquidity. In the future, vToken can be exchanged through the **Convert module** or through the **Swap module** Purchase vToken directly.

***Duration: 2020/7/21-2020/8/21***

**Event Tasks **
- Node Duration Competition
- EOS Cross-chain Contest
- Validator King Contest

**Event Rules**
- Node Duration Competition
  - The longer the node is running, the more rewards will be shared
  - Record a Time Point every minute
  - After the event, 5,000 BNCs will be divided according to the proportion of Time Point

- EOS Cross-chain Contest
  - EOS two-way cross-chain is divided into EOS testnet transfer to Asgard CC2 and Asgard CC2 transfer to EOS testnet
  - EOS testnet transfers EOS amount to Asgard CC2 ≥ 50, counting 1 cross-chain
  - Asgard CC2 transfers EOS amount to the EOS testnet ≥ 50, counts 1 cross-chain
  - Swap EOS to vEOS through Bifrost
  - After the event, 6,000 BNC will be divided according to the number of EOS cross-chains (70% weight) and vEOS balance (30% weight)

- Validator King Contest
  - Asgard CC2 opens 50 validator seats
  - Receive ASG through Faucet, self-staking + nominate the top 50 ASG nodes to be elected Validator
  - Every 3 hours (1 ERA 1800 BLOCK) re-elect validators based on the total staking amount
