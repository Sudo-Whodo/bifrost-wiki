## Getting started with Bifrost

### What is Bifrost?

Bifrost is a Polkadot parachain developed using Substrate that is vertical to the Staking Ecology. Users can swap PoS Token to Bifrost vToken through the Bifrost transfer bridge at any time to obtain Staking income and liquidity.

### Why Bifrost?

Bifrost was committed to solving three problems at the beginning. These are the reward issues of Staking and DeFi, the competition of liquidity and security, and the conflict between Staking and cross-chain. In the face of these problems, we verified an interesting solution to provide a staking derivative and use the advantages of derivatives to solve the current main problems. In addition, Bifrost has a higher annualized return than other nodes or service providers.

### How Bifrost solve these problems?

The solution to these problems is largely due to Bifrost's vToken model. vToken is a general asset used to provide staking liquidity. Using Bifrost protocol, Token can be swapped into vToken according to a certain basis. While the original Token participates in staking, vToken can make full use of the advantages of its general assets in other public chains, Dapps, and security performance to solve the problems of Staking & DeFi rewards, liquidity & security, and Staking & cross-chain.

## vToken

### What is vToken?

vToken is a general asset used to provide staking liquidity. vToken is a staking derivative generated by Bifrost protocol. vToken can optimize transactions in DeFi, Dapp, DEX and other scenarios. For example, when vToken is used as collateral for lending, the staking rewards can offset part of the interest, enabling low-interest lending.

### What are the usage scenarios of vToken?

- **Hedge**-Anti-inflation, prevent devaluation of staking assets, no lock-up position.
- **Double rewards**-Get staking rewards and DeFi interests at the same time.
- **Leverage**-Use vToken lending leverage to expand staking principal.
- **Cross-chain rewards**-Making cross-chain scenarios compatible with staking rewards.

### Which PoS tokens does Bifrost support for vToken swap?

After the Bifrost mainnet is officially launched, the first phase will open KSM, DOT, staking function and vKSM and vDOT swapping. Subsequently, vToken (vETH,vEOS, vIOST) swap for ETH,EOS and IOST will be opened one after another.

### How to get vToken?

vToken can be purchased directly from wallets, exchanges (CEX & DEX). In addition, users can swap vTokens by downloading the Bifrost Dapp after the official launch of the Bifrost mainnet.

## Staking

### What is the Bifrost Marketization Model of the staking rewards?

Bifrost improves Staking rewards by voting Marketization model. For example, KSM's voting rights in the Bifrost Staking Pool are awarded by market bidding. Whoever bids high, who gets the right to vote for the corresponding number of KSMs in the Bifrost Staking Pool. In this way, small nodes that have not reached the threshold for block production can be self-incubated and enter the public voter's field of vision to provide better services to confront head nodes, making the node network safer and healthier.

### What are the staking rewards of the PoS Token on Bifrost?

Due to Biforst's Marketization model, the reward of the PoS Tokens listed on Bifrost will be higher than the reward of ordinary staking. If KSM's current annualized reward rate is 20%, then vKSM will also be at least 20% of its annualized reward.

## BNC

### What is BNC?

BNC(Bifrost Network Coin) is the native token of Bifrost. It has 80,000,000 total supply. BNC mainly plays an active role in staking rewards and handling fees, deposits for bidding on voting rights, and governance tools.

### How much is BNC?

Currently BNC has not been circulated in the market. It is expected to circulate at least once Polkadot supports parachain and the Bifrost mainnet is online.
