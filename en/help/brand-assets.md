## User Guide

### Meaning and Composition
Bifrost’s logo is composed of graphics and text. The graphic part implies the abstract intent of the Rainbow Bridge, and the text part is Bifrost’s standard letter font

### Scenes
**About the choice of color**

On a white/light background, the "color graphics-black text" logo is preferred, and pure black logos can also be used. On a black/dark background, the "color graphics-white text" logo is preferred, and pure white logos can also be used.

**About the choice of graphics**

In formal occasions (such as official posters, cooperative publicity, formal announcements, etc.), please be sure to use the complete "graphics + text" logo.

In some other scenarios (such as project avatars, promotional pictures, social media images, etc.), you can use either a complete logo or a "single graphic logo" according to actual needs. When the display area is a square/circular area similar to 1:1 and the display size is relatively small, if there is a clear text that reflects Bifrost, it is recommended to use "Single Graphic Logo" in the Logo section.
