## Referendum proposal: Remove Sudo permissions

&#x20;In the previous Runtime upgrades, Bifrost used Sudo (super administrator privileges) to complete centralized governance upgrades. In this v0.8.5 version upgrade, Bifrost opened a democratic referendum for the first time to remove Sudo (super administrator privileges), and all BNC holders can participate in this voting to vote on their own attitude.&#x20;

The removal of Sudo is an important milestone in the Bifrost mainnet's path towards decentralization. After Sudo is removed, anyone can submit a proposal by staking BNC and propose an on-chain upgrade to the Bifrost network, and all BNC holders will vote to make a decision.&#x20;

In the next upgrade, Bifrost will initiate a v0.9.0 SALP upgrade proposal, which will include the launch of the SALP module and the opening of vsKSM and vsBond transfers. At that time, users will be able to participate in the liquidity bet of the Kusama parachain auction through Bifrost Dapp, casting vsKSM & vsBond.
