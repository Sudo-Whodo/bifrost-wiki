# On-chain Governance

The Bifrost network uses the same governance mechanism as Polkadot and Kusama. This is a relatively mature on-chain governance mechanism, which is coordinated by three parties-the public, the parliament, and the technical committee. The goal of implementing on-chain governance is to ensure that most stakeholders can always control the network. Both the public and the parliament can make proposals. After a referendum, all BNC holders can make decisions based on the weight of staking. 

**Public:** Any BNC holder. 

**Council:** In order to represent passive stakeholders, Bifrost introduced the concept of “parliament”. A parliament is an entity on the chain composed of multiple participants, and each participant represents an account on the chain. The Bifrost network initially consisted of a few initial members, and the number of seats will be gradually increased in the future. In addition to controlling the treasury, the parliament is mainly responsible for three governance tasks: proposing a reasonable referendum, canceling uncontroversial dangerous or malicious referendums, and electing technical committees. 

**Technical Committee:** The technical committee is composed of the core R&D team that successfully deploys the Bifrost parachain or the designated Bifrost project. The technical committee can work with the parliament to formulate an emergency referendum, vote quickly and implement it.
